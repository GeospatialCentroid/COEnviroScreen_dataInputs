													<li><p>Modeled temperature data obtained from North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) used to create measures. More about NLDAS: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/nldas/">http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/nldas/</a></p></li>
													<li><p>Measure was calculated only for months May through September. Data are available for all states except Alaska and Hawaii.</p></li>
													<li><p>Percentile values are calculated using data for 1979-2016.</p></li>
													<li><p>Modeled data performs relatively well in estimating temperature, however, the estimates may differ when compared to weather station-based observations. The differences vary by region and some of these differences are expected from a meteorological perspective. As a result, an area may be described as having higher or lower temperatures than actually occurred.</p></li>
													<li><p>Census tract and county-level estimates of temperature and heat index are obtained by processing modeled data, which are available by 1/8th-degree grid. The process of converting grid-level data to other geographies using a population-weighted centroid approach may lead to potential misclassification of temperature and heat index for some areas.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p><strong>Measures 1 &ndash; 6:</strong></p><p>These measures are derived from estimates of air temperature (K) at 2 meters above the surface, specific humidity (kg/kg) at 2 meters above the surface, and surface pressure (Pa) from Forcing File A of Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). NLDAS-2 is available at the 1/8th-degree grid (approximately 14x14 km) and consists of 103,936 grid cells that cover the entire United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.</p><p>The gridded raw data were summarized to the U.S. county or census tract level to aid in estimating population exposure to high temperature and heat index conditions and to enable linkage with health-related datasets. To accomplish this, U.S. census block group centroids were attributed to individual NLDAS grid cells based on a containment relationship. Maximum daily temperature and heat index were determined for each block group by identifying the maximum hourly value for each day. Using census block group population as weights, population-weighted averages by U.S. county and census tract were calculated.</p><p>Heat index was estimated using a modified version of the Rothfusz regression as implemented by the National Weather Service [1]. Relative humidity (needed for heat index calculation) was calculated from specific humidity data acquired from NLDAS-2 using the Wexler saturated water vapor pressure equation [2].</p><p>The 90<sup>th</sup>, 95<sup>th</sup>, 98<sup>th</sup>, and 99<sup>th</sup> percentile values of the daily heat metrics were determined for each county and census tract for the period between 1979 and 2019 (May &ndash; September values only). Extreme heat days are classified according to the following thresholds: (1) absolute (e.g., 90&deg;F, 95&deg;F, 100&deg;F, 105&deg;F) and (2) relative (e.g., 90<sup>th</sup>, 95<sup>th</sup>, 98<sup>th</sup>, and 99<sup>th</sup> percentile) values.</p><p>Extreme heat events are periods in which an absolute or relative threshold is surpassed for a duration of at least 2 or 3 consecutive days (specific value can be selected in the advanced options). Annual values for extreme heat events represent the total number of days in which an extreme heat event was ongoing.</p><p><strong>Measure 7:</strong></p>
<p>This measure is derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s (NOAA&rsquo;s) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) nCLIMGRID dataset (<a href="https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/daily-grids/">https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/daily-grids/</a>). The dataset contains 5km gridded fields of daily maximum, minimum, and average temperature and daily precipitation amount for the contiguous United States between January 1, 1951 and the present.</p><p>Gridded maximum temperature data are ingested and converted to the Fahrenheit scale each day. A 7-day average is then generated for each grid cell in the contiguous United States (Alaska and Hawaii data are not available). The 7 days chosen to generate the average reflect the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) week (<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf</a>). All 7 days must be available before an average is taken. The 7-day averages are then aggregated to U.S. counties, using a point-in-polygon approach. The measure is updated weekly.</p><p>For more information on the nCLIMGRID dataset, refer to this document: <a href="https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/daily-grids/docs/nclimdiv-description.pdf">https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/daily-grids/docs/nclimdiv-description.pdf</a></p></p>
